# Kara Web Framework

Kara is a web framework for the JVM written in [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/). It enables developers to build succinct, type-safe HTML and CSS all in one language.

The article [*Type-safe Web with Kotlin*](http://jaxenter.com/type-safe-web-with-kotlin-106187.html) by Andrey Breslav  illustrates the benefits of such a framework.

Check out [karaframework.com](http://karaframework.com/) to get a quick overview of the project. (Caution: Some contents are outdated.)

## Authors

The project was started by [Tiny Mission](http://tinymission.com), a small web and mobile development company hoping to use Kara as a help to work faster and write better code. 

Currently, it is actively developed by [JetBrains](http://jetbrains.com), the company behind Kotlin.

## Contributing

There's plenty of work left to do to make Kara a first class framework, and we'd welcome contributions. Contact andy at tinymission.com to get involved.
